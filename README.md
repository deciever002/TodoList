# ToDo List Application with React

Welcome to the extended documentation for the Simple ToDo List application created using React. This application showcases the use of various libraries and concepts in the React ecosystem, including `react-router-dom`, `redux`, `react-redux`, and more. Users can perform actions like adding, updating, deleting, and viewing todos. The application is also made responsive using media queries, and styling is achieved using modular CSS. Additionally, the application fetches a list of todos from JSONPlaceholder and utilizes the `react-toastify` library to display toast notifications.

## Introduction

The Simple ToDo List application is built using React, providing users with an interactive platform to manage their tasks efficiently. This documentation aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the application's features, technologies used, and development concepts.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the todo list.
- Update existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- View the list of todos.
- Application responsiveness for various screen sizes.
- Toast notifications for task-related actions.

## Technologies Used

- React
- `react-router-dom`
- Redux
- React Redux
- Media queries for responsive design
- Modular CSS for styling
- JSONPlaceholder API for fetching todos
- `react-toastify` library for toast notifications

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/deciever002/TodoList`.
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd Todolist`.
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the application with `npm start`.

## Application Structure

The application is structured as follows:

- `src/`
  - `pages/`: Contains different pages
  - `components/`: Contains reusable React components.
  - `redux/`: Manages Redux state, actions, and reducers.
  - `styles/`: Holds modular CSS files for styling.
  - `App.js`: Main application component.

## Responsive Design

Media queries have been used to ensure that the application's user interface is optimized for different screen sizes.

## Fetching Todos

Todos are fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API. This demonstrates how to interact with external APIs in a React application.

## Styling with Modular CSS

The application's styling is modularized using separate CSS files for each component. This promotes maintainability and reusability of styles.

## Toast Notifications

Toast notifications are implemented using the `react-toastify` library, providing users with feedback for actions such as adding, updating, or deleting todos.
